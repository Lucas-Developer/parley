"message-login": "Enter your password to access the magic of Parley!",
"message-login-wait": "It takes a while to log in! We've downloaded your encrypted keys and contacts from the Parley server, and they take a little while to decrypt. We should be able to speed this process up significantly with the next release.",
"message-register": "Register for Parley! Keep in mind, this will only work if you have already signed up for the service at http://parley.co",

"message-keygen": "To use encrypted email, you must have a <strong>secret key</strong>. If you have never used PGP encryption, select <strong>Generate New Key</strong> and the Parley client will set you up. If you have an existing key, I don't need to tell you to click <strong>Import Private Key</strong>.",

"message-register-wait": "Right now, we're generating your encryption keys and sending an encrypted version of them to the Parley server. It takes a little while; sorry about that. It may sound weird, but for once it will actually go faster if you move your mouse and use your keyboard while you wait - it increases system entropy during the key generation process.",

// Messages: inbox
"message-inbox-loading": "We are loading your inbox. This may take a minute or two, but again we will be able to improve that with the next release. Please be patient. Thanks! You are the best.",

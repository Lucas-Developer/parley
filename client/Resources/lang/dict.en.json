"register-wait": "Right now, we're generating your encryption keys and sending an encrypted version of them to the Parley server. It takes a little while; sorry about that. It may sound weird, but for once it will actually go faster if you move your mouse and use your keyboard while you wait - it increases system entropy during the key generation process.", 
"login-wait": "It takes a while to log in! We've downloaded your encrypted keys and contacts from the Parley server, and they take a little while to decrypt. We should be able to speed this process up significantly with the next release.", 
"saving-contacts": "Please wait while we save your contacts to the server! Again, the encryption process takes some time, but we will be speeding it up with the next release.",
"loading-inbox": "We are loading your inbox. This may take a minute or two, depending on how many encrypted messages you have. Please be patient. Thanks! You are the best." }
